We thought that we could represent the binary using ints. Each sequence of 0 or 1 would just be replaced with an int of the count of them. The compressed version would just but a smaller list of ints which would take up less space. However there are still some things to consider like which bit is the current bit when expanding. |

Turns out, run-length encoding is not too complex conceptually and to implement. I think I got pretty close on my first try but I am struggling with navigating the terminal because it has been so long and I forgot how over the break. I will ask Mr. Blick to help my test my code and then make adjustments from there. |
| Dec 1  | 9:30-10:30am | I had a lot of trouble on why my code code was not compressing correctly and the correct amount. The main issue was that I was writing in the binary as a string which messed up the data. I decided the write it in as booleans and use a while loop instead of finding the length of the string. Next I was missing teh two bottom lines of zeros. I just needed to write out the count one more time in the compression. Then after some minor fixes like starting the counts at 1 instead of zero, my code worked! |
